# Python bar chart race

Final project for Gamers First

## Prerequisites

For this to work, it's important to have FFMpeg installed and among your environment variables. If you don't have it installed, there's an easy to follow guide in Sources further down on the page. Furthermore, it's handy to have Pandas, and matplotlib modules installed on your machine. you can do so by pasting this into your command line, letting PiP do all the work.

```sh
python -m pip install pandas
python -m pip install matplotlib
```

## How to use it?

It's very simple to use, the only thing you have to keep in mind when running the script is the format in which you export your final product, you cna do so at the bottom of the script at "filename", as of now you can only use .mp4 and .gif.

You can also adjust the image size at Figsize, it currently only works with Inches
